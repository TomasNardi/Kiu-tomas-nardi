After installation, you can start the API server and begin making requests to search and manage flight information.

## Plus (Backend and Frontend Deployment)

For the technical challenge, I also set up two servers: the one requested by the interviewers and a responsive React front-end.
The backend service was deployed on Render, and the front-end on Vercel.
Since itâ€™s already live, I cloned the repository and configured it in another repo, which I can provide if needed.
